#Object Property Reference

= Introduction =

Add your content here.


= Properties =

== FIXED ==
Whether the item is fixed in the room.

== ICON ==
The icon to be used to represent the item.

== KEY ==
The name of an item that acts as a key.

== LIGHT ==
The name of an item that acts as a light source.

This property is useful mainly in items describing rooms. When a room has a light source, the light source must be lit for the contents of a room to be visible.

If you do not define a light source for a room, the game engine considers that the room is lit by an eternal light source and is always visible.

== LIT ==
Whether the object is lit.

== LOCATION ==
The name of the item that contains this item.

Items have a "contents" relationship with each other, as every item may be contained in other items. For example:
 * The player item is contained in the current room
 * Items that the player is carrying are contained in the Player item

== LOCKED ==
Whether the item is locked.

This property works in conjunction with the KEY property. When the user operates the key on the item, it becomes locked or unlocked. 

When an item is locked, the player cannot easily open or close it.

== OPEN ==
Whether the item is open or closed.
